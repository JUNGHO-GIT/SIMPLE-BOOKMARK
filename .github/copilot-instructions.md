# IMPORTANT 1

0. When writing new code or modifying existing code, keep the following highlights in mind
1. Please reply in "Korean" unless requested in English.
2. Never change comments in the code I send, even if they are simple "-----" lines.
3. Use "JUST ONE SPACE" around assignment operators (ex. '=' or ':') and avoid more than one spacing for alignment.
4. Never break a line before a semicolon.
5. Always use line breaks and indentation in parentheses, square brackets, etc.
6. When rewriting, avoid using 'if' statements whenever possible and use symbols like the ternary operator or '&&' instead.
7. When modifying existing code, revise all 'if' statements to use the ternary operator or symbols like '&&' for brevity.
8. Nevertheless, only in the absolutely unavoidable case where you must use an 'if' conditional statement, follow these guidelines:

8-1. All if statements must use braces { } and proper line breaks/indentation, especially when they contain return statements.
8-2. Never write "if" statements on a single line. Always use braces { } even for single-line statements.
8-3. Use "}\n\telse {" or "}\n\telse if {" or "}\n\tcatch {" instead of "}else{" or "}else if {" or "}catch{".
8-4. Convert all single-line if statements like "if (condition) return value;" to:"if (condition) {\n\treturn value;\n}"
